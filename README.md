### Intro

Our topic is to analyse the cost of living trends in 2022. The rationale behind this is as we are all currently living in the difficult times 
bought on by the cost of living crisis which is effecting all of us in the group.
So we all had a personal motivation to look at this subject, but wanted to see the effects on a more grander scale. 
We will create a webpage dashboard that allows you to look at 4 levels of data related to heat map looking at the cost of living data, 2 visuals
looking at the cheapest and most expensive places to live and lastly, a visual looking at house prices and rent for our selected locations.

## Front End

For the front end we based our web based dashboard on our final wire frame.

### 1. HTML Pages
firstly, we built the html webpage that our visual dashboard would sit on the main piece of work here was to create our drop down list as opposed to the 
easier route of creating seperate pages for our visuals to sit on.  
As well as the course links for our visualisations.

### 2. SQL Database & app.py
secondly, we create our script to connect our databased to the html and defined the routes for the data by creating and "app.route". And defined the data we wanted to select from our database table and connect and injected into our webpage. Now that this was done we could focus on creating our visuals.

### 3. Java Script
