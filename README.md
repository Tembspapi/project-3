### Intro

Our topic is to analyse the cost of living trends in 2022. The rationale behind this is as we are all currently living in the difficult times 
bought on by the cost of living crisis which is effecting all of us in the group.
So we all had a personal motivation to look at this subject, but wanted to see the effects on a more grander scale. 
We will create a webpage dashboard that allows you to look at 4 levels of data related to heat map looking at the cost of living data, 2 visuals looking at the cheapest and most expensive places to live and lastly, a visual looking at house prices and rent for our selected locations.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
